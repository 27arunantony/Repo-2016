Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence models I developed during the last 5 years, from scratch, tutorials and various internet sources.

I code in R and Python since 2013 and in Wolfram Mathematica since 2005.
