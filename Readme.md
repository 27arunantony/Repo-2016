Welcome to my GitHub page. I am a Data Scientist and I code in R, Python and Wolfram Mathematica. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence models I developed from scratch, tutorials and internet research.

For examples of the outputs of these models, access my Portfolio at: http://www.slideshare.net/RubensZimbres/my-portfolio-77-dec-2016
