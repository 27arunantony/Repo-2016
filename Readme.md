Welcome to my GitHub page. 

I am a Data Scientist and I code in R, Python and Wolfram Mathematica. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence models I developed:

------------------
MATHEMATICA CODES:

MNIST_HOT.5.FULL	is a solution for the MNIST dataset in Mathematica, with 96.51% accuracy, based on difference of pixels.

Mathematica - Artificial Intelligence Simulating Interactions in Social Networks	is a model that simulates human interactions in a social network using cellular automata and agent-based modeling. Each agent has 3 possible choices for interation. The code has 14 pages.

Mathematica - Social Network Surveillance	is a model that tracks individuals in a social network and predicts future connections.


------------------
PYTHON CODES:

Python - Autoencoder MNIST	is an autoencoder model for classiciaftion of images, in this case, the MNIST dataset.

Python - Autoencoder for Text Classification	is an autoencoder model for classification of text made with Keras.

Python - Deep Learning with Lasagne	is a deep neural network developed with Lasagne.

Python - Face Recognition	is a model using OpenCV to detect faces.

Python - Image Extraction from Twitter	is a model that extracts pictures and their links from Twitter webpages.

Python - Keras Convolutional Neural Network is a CNN developed to classify the MNIST dataset with an accuracy greater than 99%.

Python - Keras Deep Regressor	is a deep Neural Network for prediction of a continuous output.

Python - Keras LSTM Network	is a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to predict and generate text.

Python - Keras Multi Layer Perceptron	is a MLP model, for prediction and classification.

Python - Machine Learning is a Principal Components Analysis followed by a Linear Regression.

Python - NLP Doc2Vec	is a Natural Language Processing model where I asked a Wikipedia webpage a question and 4 possible answers were semantically chosen from the tokenized and vectorized webpage.

Python - NLP Semantic Analysis	is a model that classifies a given sentence according to similarity to other sentences, using cosine distance.

Python - NLP Word2Vec	is a model developed from scratch to measure cosine similarity among words.

Python - Reinforcement Learning	is a model based on rules and Game Theory where agents attitude change according to payoff achieved.

Python - Social Networks	is a model that draws social networks configuration and connections.

Python - Support Vector Machines	is a Machine Learning model that classifies the Iris dataset

Python - Theano Deep Learning	is a Neural Network with two hidden layers


------------------
R CODES:

R - Churn of Customers is a model that uses a logistic regression associated with a threshold to predict which customers present the greater risk to be lost.

R - Data Cleaning + Multinomial Regression	is a model that presents data cleaning and a multinomial regression using package nnet to classify customers according to their level of loyalty.

R - Face Recognition	is a code to detect faces and objects in R.

R - Geolocation	is a file for geo-spatial localization.

R - Geolocation USA	is also a file for geo-spatial localization, USA map.

R - Gradient Descent + Regularization	is a model that performs a gradient descent and a regularization, developed from scratch.

R - H2O Deep Learning	is a Neural Network model developed to predict recommendations and word-of-mouth advertising.

R - MNIST	is a solution for the MNIST dataset, developed from scratch.

R - Markov Chains	is a simple visualization of Markov Chains and probabilities associated.

R - NeuralNet	is a Neural Network model developed to predict and classify word-of-mouth advertising.

R - Ridge Regression is a model with Ridge Regularization made from scratch to prevent overfitting.
