Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence models I developed during the last 5 years, from scratch, tutorials and various internet sources.

I am a Data Scientist from Brazil and I code in R and Python since 2013 and in Wolfram Mathematica since 2005.

For examples of the outputs of these models, access my Portfolio at: http://www.slideshare.net/RubensZimbres/my-portfolio-77-dec-2016
